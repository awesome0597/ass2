     * (50,50) to (500,500) and the second between (450,450) (600,600) and are given the colors gray and yellow
     * respectively. A loop runs through all the radii in the array creating a new variable of type Ball using the
     * functio×ž createNewBall, and giving them a corresponding velocity in relation to their size (the bigger the ball
     * the slower it goes, note the speed of balls bigger and including 50 have a set speed),
     * Then velocity is received in the form 'speed' and 'angle' and is converted to dx, dy using the fromSpeedAndAngle
     * function in Velocity, and it is assigned to ball. Create new ball also receives a frame indicating
     * what the limits for the center can be. The first half of the array is sent with the values from the first frame
     * and the second half with those from the second frame. We then enter the loop that draws the animation. First we
     * call changeVelocity so moveOneStep won't send the ball out of the frame (both methods reside in Ball class). We
     * then create our drawSurface, draw the Ball on it and have it shown to the user. Then there is a sleeper to give
